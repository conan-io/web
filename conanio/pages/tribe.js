              Their feedback has been of great value to the critical decisions that have been taking place during the development of Conan 2.0.</b>
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3">
              Conan 2.0 Tribe members are active Conan users and contributors from some of the most relevant companies and organizations worldwide which have volunteered to provide quality feedback in a consistent and unbiased way. These professionals develop software for industries such as aerospace, finance, automotive, healthcare, and entertainment.

            <h2>How does the Conan tribe work?</h2>
            <p className="pb-3">
              Most of the interactions of the tribe are open and take place in the <Link href="https://github.com/conan-io/tribe" ><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conan Tribe Github</a></Link> repository. Here, the issues regarding vital decisions for the future of Conan have been be discussed and voted upon. Although anyone could to comment, the number of upvotes and downvotes of only the members of the tribe is heavily weighted towards the final decision. We discussed items of impact in Conan 2.0, such as improving Conan’s graph model, changing defaults, or modernizing build system toolchains and practices.
            </p>
            <h2>Is it possible to become a member of the tribe?</h2>
            <p className="pb-3">
              Now that Conan 2.0 is GA, we will discuss with the Tribe the way going forward for strategic changes to Conan,
              future major 3.0, 4.0 versions, etc. We will also talk about the Tribe itself and there will be opportunities to join.
              In the meantime, everybody is welcome to give feedback in the
